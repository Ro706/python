#Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple and fun game for 2 players, X and O. It is played on a 3x3 grid. Each player's goal is to make 3 in a row. Typically, X starts first, but in Gametable's Tabletop Tic Tac Toe, Player 1 starts first on the first game and Player 2 (or the computer) starts first on the next game.
